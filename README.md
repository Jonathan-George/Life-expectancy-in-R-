In this project, i analyzed the Life expectancy of countries by their GDP. The findings from my project, indicate that countries with higher GDP, above the median range, have a higher life expectancy than countries with lower GDP, below the median range. While the higher GDP is highlighted by the blue histogram, the lower GDP chat is highlighted by the red histogram. The histogram can be found attached in the pdf file titled Life Expectancy in Rplot.
